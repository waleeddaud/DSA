# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! ðŸš€  
This repo contains my journey through foundational DSA concepts, including implementations and problem-solving approaches for arrays, sorting, searching, graphs, trees, heaps, stacks, queues, linked lists, and more.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of my solutions and implementations of common DSA problems. The purpose of this repo is to:
- Reinforce my understanding of core data structures and algorithms.
- Provide an organized resource for others learning DSA.
- Showcase my problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

I hope this collection helps anyone preparing for coding interviews or looking to strengthen their understanding of these fundamental concepts. Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to this repository!

## Topics Covered

This repository includes solutions and implementations for the following topics:

- **Arrays**:
  - Insertion, deletion, and traversal.
  - Common problems like subarray sums, merging arrays, etc.

- **Searching**:
  - Linear search.
  - Binary search.

- **Sorting**:
  - Bubble sort.
  - Merge sort.
  - Quick sort.
  - Heap sort.

- **Linked Lists**:
  - Singly linked lists.
  - Doubly linked lists.
  - Circular linked lists.

- **Stacks and Queues**:
  - Stack operations using arrays and linked lists.
  - Queue operations (regular and circular queues).
  - Priority queues.

- **Trees**:
  - Binary trees.
  - Binary Search Trees (BST).
  - AVL trees.
  - Tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

- **Graphs**:
  - Graph traversal (DFS, BFS).
  - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
  - Cycle detection and topological sorting.

- **Heaps**:
  - Min-heap and max-heap.
  - Heap operations (insertion, deletion).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waleeddaud/DSA.git
   cd DSA
   ```

2. **Navigate to the specific topic**:
   Each folder in the repository is categorized by the topic (e.g., arrays, graphs, etc.).

3. **Run the code**:
   - For C++/Python solutions, you can run the code directly using a compiler or interpreter:
     ```bash
     # For C++:
     g++ filename.cpp -o output
     ./output

     # For Python:
     python filename.py
     ```
